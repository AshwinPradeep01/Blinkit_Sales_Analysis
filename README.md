THE BLINKIT STORY: From Groceries to 'Grocery at Speed of Light'

In a country where waiting days for grocery delivery was the norm, Blinkit revolutionized the way Indians shop by transforming a simple idea into a quick commerce phenomenon. Blinkit (formerly Grofers) didn't just want to deliver groceries – it wanted to deliver time itself back to people's lives.

Founded in 2013 as Grofers by Albinder Dhindsa and Saurabh Kumar, what started as a B2B delivery service for local stores transformed into one of India's leading quick-commerce platforms. The company's pivotal moment came in December 2021 when it rebranded to Blinkit, marking its evolution from a standard grocery delivery service to a quick-commerce pioneer promising 10-minute deliveries.

The company was acquired by Zomato in 2022 for ₹4,447 crore ($570 million), marking one of the largest consolidations in India's quick-commerce space. From its origins in Gurgaon to becoming a pan-India phenomenon, Blinkit revolutionized urban retail by introducing the concept of "instant commerce" through its network of dark stores.

Today, Blinkit operates across major Indian cities, delivering everything from groceries to electronics in minutes. Their success lies in their hyperlocal dark store model, advanced technology infrastructure, and deep understanding of Indian consumer behavior. The platform has transformed from a simple grocery delivery service to an essential part of urban Indian life, processing millions of orders monthly and setting new standards in the quick-commerce industry.
